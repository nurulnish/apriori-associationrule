## Introduction
Association rules mining is a rule-based method for discovering interesting relations between variables in large databases. It is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some measures of interestingness. We used confidence as a measure of interestingness.
**The main purpose of this project is to get an in depth understanding of how the Apriori algorithm works.**
We implemented support counting using hash trees. The difference between out approach is significant as demonstrated by the following run times (we used the same value of ```MINSUP``` and ```MIN_CONF``` for both) -

Support counting using brute force- ```22.5s```

Support counting using hash tree- ```5.9s ```

*For the sake of comparison, we have left in the code for the brute force method commented. Please feel free to uncomment it and try it out.*

## Data
We used the **Groceries Market Basket Dataset**, which can be found [here](http://www.sci.csueastbay.edu/~esuess/classes/Statistics_6620/Presentations/ml13/groceries.csv). The dataset contains **9835 transactions** by customers shopping for groceries. The data contains **169 unique items**. The data can be found in the folder **'data'**.

## Instructions to run the scripts
Run the following command:

##### Create the train matrix and the mappings
```python
python arm.py
```

## Important variables
```
MINSUP - Minimum support
HASH_DENOMINATOR - Denominator for the hash function (For support counting using hash tree)
MIN_CONF - Minimum confidence
```

## Hash Function
We have used hash function of the followinng format-
```x(mod)k```
where k is chosen by the user.

## Equations used
```
confidence(X->Y) = support(X U Y) / support(X)
support(X, Y) = support count(X, Y) / total dataset size
```


## Pre-processing done
The csv file was read transaction by transaction and each transaction was saved as a list.
A mapping was created from the unique items in the dataset to integers so that each item corresponded to a unique integer.
The entire data was mapped to integers to reduce the storage and computational requirement.
A reverse mapping was created from the integers to the items, so that the item names could be written in the final output file.

## Prescribed format of output
##### Association Rules
```
Precedent (itemset (support count)) ---> Antecedent (itemset (support count)) - confidence value
```

##### Frequent itemsets
```
Frequent itemset (support count)
```


## Machine specs
Processor: i7-7500U

Ram: 16 GB DDR4

OS: Ubuntu 16.04 LTS

## Results

| Confidence/Support | No. of itemsets | No of rules |
|---------------------|-------|--------|
| High confidence(MIN_CONF=0.5) High support count(MINSUP=60)               | 725  |  60      |
| Low confidence(MIN_CONF=0.1) High support count(MINSUP=60)              | 725   |    1189    |
| High confidence(MIN_CONF=0.5) Low support count(MINSUP=10)              | 11390   |    4187    |
| Low confidence(MIN_CONF=0.1) Low support count(MINSUP=10)              | 11390   |    35196    |

All the frequent itemsets and rules generated using the above mentioned configurations can be found in the 'results' folder.
